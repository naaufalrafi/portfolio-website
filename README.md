# portfolio-website

Hello!!! This is my first portfolio website. I'm making this website using vanilla html, css, and a little bit css for the navbar

Some of u maybe asking, why don't I don't use any framework like bootstrap? The answer is simple, because this is not a complicated website and this is a very good code exercise for me, that's why i don't use any framework

DISCALIMER!! THIS WEBSITE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
